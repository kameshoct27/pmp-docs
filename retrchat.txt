Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:42 PM
Hello
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:42 PM
Hi 
Are you still around?
Please tell me
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:42 PM
yes, but not for long
couple of things...
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:42 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:43 PM
ZWSD86AN and ZWSD40AN, BN, CN, DN - we have 10/28 and 10/29 on hold
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:43 PM
Yes
I will put 10/30 on hold
today before 8AM EST
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:44 PM
ok, great
they are having a call at 9:00
on CDW status and next steps....do you have that invite by any chance
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:46 PM
Who sent the meeting request Lev?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:47 PM
I dont have it, I thought you may be had it, but never mind. Anderw Oliu sent an email at 1:30 est and he mentioned about it
I can ask Andrew
he didnt say much, basically:
DW recovery to the COB database was successful and we have begun re-running batch for October 27th. 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:48 PM
Oh.. then I am not in the invitee list
Yes even I got this update from the CDW GPA team here
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:49 PM
does COB have any impact on our jobs
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:49 PM
And I told them not to release any triggers before consultign me
No..
they said that it's just a test drill like how it works for 27th data since it was already proceessed in PROD but they will not send any of the feeds to their downstream
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:50 PM
ok, then I am lost - why they are doing it...as a test
anyway jsut keep your ears open:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:51 PM
Just to confirm that everything works in COB accurately as if it works in PROD
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:51 PM
aside from CDW issues, one other item
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:51 PM
Ok. pls tell me
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:52 PM
BR Xref MSD file changes 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:52 PM
I saw your mail 
Shall I check with Mukul on this?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:53 PM
Yes, please. I have to respond to MSD as they are implementing on 11/7
ut I havent given them my final signoff
they might implement anyway, I am not sure
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:53 PM
Ok..sure.. I will check
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:54 PM
the challenge is, just to repeat....
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:54 PM
But what about our mainframe changes?
Are we done with that?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:54 PM
that initially noone noticed how they are changing the schedule
MSD changing the schedue
the new file is ready 4:30-5:00 next morning vs current old file is done ad 20:00
our MF changes are pretty much done (almost done)
and we palnned to keep CDW file in the same format, just the two fields will be blank
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:56 PM
Yes.. I remember this as per our earlier discusssion
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:57 PM
but now, the concern is - can they wait until 5am and if so do they need to change their schedule
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:57 PM
Ok..
I will bring this point with CDW
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:57 PM
woudl be good to know how important this is to their process and if any impact is possible at all
for us on the MF, it is not that important any more. because the datra is not complete 100%, therefore it is not 100% reliable, so 95% or 80% - doesnt make a huge difference
right now, we can live without this data
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:59 PM
Ok.. Yes.. I will discuss with them.. but the challenge is they are completely occupied with catch up
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:00 PM
yes, I know
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:00 PM
But I will definetly try to bring our concerns and get them clarified with them
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:00 PM
but I have to tell something to MSD
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:00 PM
Yes Lev I agree
I will update you today itself
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:01 PM
thanks
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:01 PM
Lev, this job - ZSMD196N will be delayed after their impl
Am I right?
which runs in between 4 to 5AM?
t+1
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:02 PM
not exactly. this job is being retured. The job that creates the new file ZSMD98N runs 4:30-5:00, it is already in production
198
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:02 PM
Oh ok ok
got it
I will ping you in your morning time with update
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:04 PM
it is based on Delta from SMC; and they also have a weekly job which runs on Monday early am, and processes "full" file from SMC - but this has no impact on our schedule as we have nothing running on Sunday or Monday monrning
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:04 PM
Yes
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:06 PM
Ok.
Lev.. go to bed
I will ping you in your morning
Have good sleep for few hours
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:07 PM
:)
question of the day:
if our batch is not going to run for a few more days
what can we do to account for any CURR and ASOF files that may be expiring
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:08 PM
:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:08 PM
and maybe take preventive action, whatever that may be
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:09 PM
Yes ..I am expecting that they deliver today
if not we need to look for backign up datasets
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:10 PM
ok - please keep that in mind, and maybe this needs to be documented somewhere, especially if you do run some backups. In case you are on vacation the next time this happens
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:11 PM
Ok Lev sure.. :)

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:44 PM
Good morning Lev
I checked with Mukul and they have to make changes to process the file due to change in the date at their end so he forwarded to Appala
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:56 PM
another option would be for us to continue sending the file at teh same time as we do today, but the data will be missing a few cusips. The file is not 100% complete today. The reason for this change is to moke it "more complete" by using a different source
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:58 PM
Ok..
Based on their response,we can update them
What do you say?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:58 PM
what do you mean
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:59 PM
If CDW is ready to handle the date change then 
it will be ok.. 
they are receiving lot of file from us in similar fashion
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:00 PM
Are you convinced they have to make a change? - what date is he referring to?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:00 PM
so the change would be simple I guess
Mukul had a look into the code and then confimred to Appala thru mail statign that change is required
Lev, on a different note
This is related to ZCCDPA8N - LOPR job failure
strange issue
JOB54411 IGD17288I DATA SET OPIPRDC.USER.CPI.CPIMAST.REC01 530 
          COULD NOT BE ALLOCATED NORMALLY AND IS NOT ELIGIBLE 
          FOR SPACE CONSTRAINT RELIEF (MULTI VOLUME) BECAUSE IT IS 
          A END-OF-VOLUME SITUATION. 
          SPACE CONSTRAINT RELIEF (SPACE REDUCTION AND/OR 5 EXTENT 
          LIMIT RELIEF) WILL BE ATTEMPTED 

Shall I try with more FREE SPACE
FREESPACE(22 5)

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:03 PM
do you want to join that call, it has not started yet
freespace is different
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:04 PM
Sorry I forgot to tell you. CDW cob database has data up to last week which is why there started processing from 10/27
regardign faiilure - Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:05 PM
is there volume specified
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:06 PM
MGMTCLAS (X014N014)

CYLINDERS(1700 2000) - 

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:09 PM
If I increase the CYL then will it work?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:11 PM
Not sure. reading the message,,,it may work if you try again - if space becomes available on the sme volume
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:12 PM
I tried second time but it failed again
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:19 PM
any way to point to a different volume?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:20 PM
you mean to code VOLUME parameter
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:20 PM
can you tell me what date has to change and why on the BR xref feed
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:20 PM
Ok sure
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:20 PM
yes, possibly volume
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:21 PM
We send the file with businesss date suffix like - Brxref_YYYYMMDD.txt 
But on the same date at 20:00
So they have the current date in their config files I guess 
Since we will be sending the file around 4:30 AM next day then they have use Calender date which is business date instead of current date
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:24 PM
we can change the date too if that makes them happy
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:24 PM
Ok..
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:25 PM
of course it is better if they change, but we can do - as long as that will solve the problem and will not cause more issues
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:26 PM
If they ask for time to make this change then we will suggest our changes :)
Appala has to take a decision on this since he is the CDW app manager
But if you thnk that we can make changes then we can take a call
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:27 PM
if we make the change, then Appala does not have to make a decision, right?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:28 PM
Yes Lev.. correct
:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:28 PM
he may be too busy with cdw issues to even look at that emai;
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:28 PM
I agree.
Shall I update to Mukul on this or will you be able to reply thru mail?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:29 PM
i would be more concerned if this delay impacts their processing. it looks like the data is loaded when it is received, but the question is - when is it really used (if used at all)?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:31 PM
Ok.. I think it is not used in any major process which is why they are not much concerned
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:32 PM
so it souds as if we "fix" the date then they will not be too upset about scheduling ?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:32 PM
Yes Lev.. hopefully..
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:32 PM
I will reply n a few minutes
to his email
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:33 PM
Ok.. 
They are all in the call related to COB database issues
Shall I code like this?
VOLUMES(SHS996) -

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:35 PM
Volume not available

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:39 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:40 PM
i think this is "data reduction", right?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:40 PM
yes 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:41 PM
then I think it is not critical at all? these files are loaded - but is anyone using them?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:42 PM
No..it's not critical
and also as you pointed out, they are not using them
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:43 PM
anyway, I think...when this was implemented, someone must have given "us" volumes to use, and these volumes should have space for us. if this is the case, then maybe this should be assigned to DASD team to figure out why space is not there
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:44 PM
Ok.. do you have their DL or any contact by chance?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:44 PM
no, i doubt it
GCC should know
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:45 PM
Ok.. 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:48 PM

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:14 PM
I called them Hotline and they suggested me to run with 500 500 CYL
Exisign volumes are very high
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:14 PM
they know better
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:15 PM
Thank you Lev as always
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:25 PM
It went fine after pointing to 500 500
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:26 PM
great - they know better
save that contact for the future too
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:26 PM
already saved it :)

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:14 AM
hello
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:15 AM
Hi 
Pls tell me
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:15 AM
I see they want you to run PB jobs
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:15 AM
Yes..
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:15 AM
pls remember to run from EMER with date overrides
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:16 AM
Sure.. I will run one set then successor set so that there is no issue like we had last time
But FILRCR will be delivered in the evening it seems
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:16 AM
ok, take it slow, there is no rush - because users will not be looking at the reports until Monday
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:17 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:18 AM
also, you should keep Satya in the loop
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:18 AM
sure. will do. Thanks for reminding me
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:18 AM
I think he was going to run his jobs without PB data, but I dont know if he actually did
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:19 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:19 AM
i will be offline for a couple of hours, but I will be back
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:19 AM
Ok..no probs..
I will be cautious while scheduling the jobs
pls carry on
I will update you once you are back
:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:20 AM
ok, thanks

Just to give an update -  PB jobs ran fine as of 10/28 except ZGCD407N which is dependent on FILRCR
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 11:37 AM
They have sent the 10/29 trigger but i will start processing once we are done with 10/28

Atleast have good rest for tonight :)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:51 PM
ok
I will be around for a while, need to do other things besides work
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:54 PM
ok
This conversation is saved in the Conversations tab in Lync and in the Conversation History folder in Outlook.
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:18 PM
can you please remind me - did we receive any feedback on BR MSD Xref regarding scheduling shift. I did sent an email on that, did you hear anything back? I suspect not since they are so busy:) 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:19 PM
Yes Lev no reply from them 
When I asked Mukul, the change is very simple at their end
so it is better to make at their end
What do you say?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:24 PM
it doesnt matter who makes the change as long as we are in sync. The new MSD file is already in production. MSD is looking to retire the old job/file, that is why they are pushing, and they wanted to retire on 11/7 
I think we can negotiate to push it back a few days.... What was Mukul's response on the fact that the file will come later - will that delay their process or do they run later than 5am anyway ? 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:28 PM
He does not any issues with late delivery
but we need a formal mail on this
*not see
I will try to push them to respond by Monday 
we will implement Lev
let them take a call
since it's a small change for them :)
This conversation is saved in the Conversations tab in Lync and in the Conversation History folder in Outlook.
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:05 PM
great! I think we can push the date maybe by a week but not more, but we must commit on the date to thel MSD team 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:05 PM
ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:06 PM
it must be difficult for cdw to make any changes until they are cought up and runing stable
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:08 PM
we can adjust on our side a little, if necessary to sync up our hard date to CDW readiness, i.e. we can start reading new file, but continue sending it at 20:00 (although data will be a day old); then enter dependency on the MSD job and that will delay the job to 5:00
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:12 PM
yes Lev
for now you pls confir m to MSD 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:13 PM
what date ?
it may be too late for 11/7
I will chack with them on Monday
they were looking for my approval on Thursday, so I assume they will now change the date anyway, we will know the situation Monday, 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:16 PM
11/14
YES
I will update on Monday
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:16 PM
did taht come from MSD?
from CDW I mean
?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:26 PM
No Lev
I am just saying
I will update once they confirm
sorry I am having my lunch
so bit late response

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:01 AM
yes, kind of
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:01 AM
Ok.. this is not urgent
Did you get a chance to read my mail related to sftp jobs?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:02 AM
yes, but did not look at the jobs
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:03 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:03 AM
ok - I think I know what this is, we had this a while back
just like it reads....someone holding the file - the user
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:04 AM
But I tried after 2 hour
even then it failed
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:05 AM
user left the file open...
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:05 AM
Oh.. ok 
Those are empty files
is that ok If I skip them
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:05 AM
maybe even beyond that.....user's desktop may have crashed, but the file is somehow still locked by the user
I can send him a quick note, he will respond omn Monday hopefully
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:07 AM
Ok. What do you suggest in this case?
Is there any better way than my approach?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:07 AM
If this happens, that file which causes the error should be removed from ftp cards
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:08 AM
I did the samething
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:08 AM
I cant think of anything better
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:08 AM
since the first 6 are processed already so I removed 7 including this from ftp cards
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:10 AM
Please let me know whenever you receive response from the user 
just to be documented
Thank you Lev
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:16 AM
Got your mail
Thanks
I am about loggin off
Is there anything that you need from me?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:23 AM

Hi Lev
I will verify the FillRCR file first and then will proceed with our jobs
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:17 AM
ok, thanks. Also, see if CDW can providfe an explanation of why this happened. I think we all know...but let;s hear it from them. after all, I will have to pass that to the user tomorrow.
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:18 AM
Ok.. sure will do
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:18 AM
the file is delimited and difficult to browse in TSO. either 1) need to run it throiugh zccd860n in test or 2) download to excel
I can give you column headings for excel if you need
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:19 AM
Ok Lev..pls send it to me.
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:19 AM
in a few minutes
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:19 AM
I will download to excel and verify
They are not giving any ETA

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:49 AM
ok, sent RCR samples. I need to take break, 2-3 hours probably.
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:49 AM
sure Lev.. thanks
Please
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:49 PM
Lev
They identified the issue and generatign the corrrect feed for 10/28
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:53 PM
I am not sure we want to rerun, but we definitely want to look at the data
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:53 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:54 PM
rerunnig would involve 3 reports and a cusip list - all of which have been looked at by the user on Monday
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:55 PM
Ok.. pls let me know if required. 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:56 PM
let's see what it looks like
need to be careful about extra triggers - I hope they will not send the trigger
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:56 PM
Yes Lev..
Yesterday I asked not to send the trigge
since they sent the trigger for 10/27 twice
yesterday I pulled the file when they wre ready
And I told them clearly
Also we put HOLD on our jobs
Today I will put HOLD on 11/03 jobs as well
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:58 PM
ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:01 PM
I dont know when are we going to be on BAU :)
We have 4 days batch catch up which is yet to be done
All of a sudden they ask some files to be resent during night 
which is very headache
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:41 PM
Are we expecting to hear more feedback on BR MSD Xref? - we discussed last week, mainly the timing change from 20:00 to 4-5am next day. I understand that this cant be their priority right now, but do we have a confirmation that this file is not critical - if so, we willlet MSD retire their  old file, start using the new file, but will not change timing until CDW is ready
I think Mukul was going to respond by email?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:44 PM
yes Lev I agree. He said that he will respond 
But I did not see any reply from him
i will check with him on this
But as you said pls let MSD retire 
We should let them wait for longer time
If their job fails then they will fix it immediately :)
*we should not
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:56 PM
but I need some sort of confirmation or something I can use to justify my signoff to MSD
we received their response previously, on the two fields which will be blank - fine, seems they are not concened muc. but now we are talking about sending them the file from prior day, at least for some time, and then we will change shcedule to run at 4-5 am.
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:30 PM
Sorry Lev I had been to lunch and came back
I will check with them and update you on this
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:13 PM
Good morning Lev
is there any action item pending on Restriction file from my end?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 11:57 PM
Did we hear anything from users on 10/28 Fillrcr data?
Do we need to rerun them
?
11/5/2014
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:15 AM
do we have the file?
new file?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:18 AM
They said that they have placed the file 
but yet to verify
I mean we did nt pul the file
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:19 AM
how?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:19 AM
They did some changes when I asked abt root cause then I did not get response
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:20 AM
can you pull the  file? maybe to ECNS
but if it is prod it;s ok too
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:24 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:25 AM
do they also have 10/29?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:25 AM
No not yet
I will only run ZWSD86AN now
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:25 AM
ok, that's what we want
i will need to compare to the original run and decide if reports need to be rerun
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:27 AM
Ok.. If rerun is required then shall I do it tomorrow?:P
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:27 AM
dont worry about it
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:28 AM
ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:28 AM
when do you plan to be back?
I mean you will logoff in a little while, then - when you plan to be back tonoight (tomorrow)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:29 AM
I will login at 9PM of your time
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:29 AM
ok, then you should plan to logoiff soon:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:29 AM
Once I pull it then I will update and logoff
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:29 AM
when will Sarma be back?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:29 AM
but not sure if they call me and ask something in between
Monday
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:32 AM
you have run whatever backup jobs needed for CURR and ASOF, right
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:32 AM
Lev I wanted to update you on this
I ran the job yesterday when I could see 2 versions
But it was abended due to space issue it seems
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:33 AM
space on tape?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:33 AM
which i noticed today and when tryign to submit those datasets, they are not avialble
SB37
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:34 AM
I need to see - do you have the jcl
output
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:34 AM
All files are backed up except Ocean Equiry
ZCCR002N
PROD.FTPIN.CGSRESTR.EXTR

I just used FASTCOPY
Restr file has been pulled
Since 2 version are available yesterday I though I will try today as well but they are gone this morning
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:37 AM
all these files seem to be DISK, you had no UNIT
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:38 AM
Yes.. they are copied to disk only
But we have received all triggers yesterday excpet ZWSDIWDS
which is the Big file
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:39 AM
I see the gen# in the job is 9, so that means it had about 8 days of data from Oct 1
8 or 9
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:40 AM
Yes Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:40 AM
but we will still have to pull all of September, right?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:40 AM
Yes correct
We are missing bothe September and October data
We received Sep29th data which is backed up in Tape
but not yet processed
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:42 AM
ok, seems these Oct tapes are gone. I ram a tape listing, and they are not even showing up
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:43 AM
when I ran the copy, I could see 2 versions 8 and 9 but this morning they are gone
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:44 AM
maybe they were "overdue" to be scratched, I mean they were past exp date ( my guess)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:44 AM
Ok.. 
1 day file is avaialble in backups
SHS.NCA.FTPIN.OCEAN.EQ*.BKUP.*

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:47 AM
On a different note, can you copy the below to SSYG.*
PROD.NCC.PCCDP79N.PTC317.#5DAY.G0999V00
PROD.NCC.PCCDP79N.PTC317.#5DAY.G1000V00
PROD.NCC.PCCDP79N.PTC317.#5DAY.G1001V00
PROD.NCC.PCCDP79N.PTC317.#5DAY.G1002V00

You have already copied till 998
Tomorrow I will call up to storage management and check if there is a way to recover these tapes:P
One in Sep version and the latest October version
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:49 AM
ok, copied
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:50 AM
Thank you
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:50 AM
ok, so you are ready to logoff?
I will look into RCR data, compare to prod file
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:51 AM
Ok.. please ping or mail me for further steps
I will take care of them with fresh brain
:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:51 AM
I dont want to rerun, hopefully we will not have to
good night!
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:51 AM
Thanks. Bye
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:25 AM
I am back Lev
Did you get a change to look at 10/28 data and do we need to rerun by any chance?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:37 AM
We just received the 10/29 trigger
Shall I pull the file and put HOLD on ZCCD860N?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:12 AM
Do you have any test JCL to run the job - ZCCD860N for data integrity?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:20 AM
yes, I ran something for 10/28, but not guaranteed to work for you
you should definitely pull the file
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:20 AM
i pulled the file Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:22 AM
ok, let me run it. I am running a couple of copy jobs first, but shoul dbe done in 5 min
what is the file name
prod?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:22 AM
yes
1 sec
PROD.FTPIN.CGSRESTR.EXTR

I put HOLD on ZCCD860N
I will release it after data verification
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:24 AM
I need to step away for a couple of hours
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:24 AM
this is for 10/29 batch
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:24 AM
would you rather wait until I get back?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:25 AM
Ok Lev 
I will also get ready and go to office in 2 hrs
Now logged in from home
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:25 AM
you can prepare the overrides in the meantime

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:25 AM
I have made them ready :)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:26 AM
i copied the file to SSYG.FTPIN.ZWSD86AN.CGSRSRCH.RESTR.G0275X 

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:26 AM
Once your job is run then pls give me the JCL also I will keep it for reference if required in future
Ok. Thanks
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:29 AM
SSYG.USER.CGSRESTR.JCL(ZTST860X)
running now
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:29 AM
Oh.. great
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:29 AM
outputs will be under ecns.nc5 and wrkt.nc5
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:30 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:30 AM
but I need to step away now, I don;t want to ruch with this, we have time, right?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:30 AM
I have decided to raise request for prod and ssyg access :)
will do it today
Yes.. we do have time
please carry on
I will ping you later
no hurry at all
Thank you
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:31 AM
job done
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:31 AM
Ok
I will check the outputs
You pls carry on 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 10:32 AM
I will be back:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:33 AM
Ok
Data looks good.. All cusip with 28th & 29th effective date
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 10:38 AM
But I will wait for your go ahead on this
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:40 PM
I have been looking at the data for some time
for the most part it is good
something bothers me just a little...
on this file WRKT.NC5.PCCD860N.RESTSEC.FMT.EXP

the first 918 records look like some "garbage". they are from 2011or 2012, and dont have cusips

since they dont have cusips, they will hae no impact on further processing, they will get dropped
but...it makes me wonder if the rest of the data can be trusted
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:50 PM
ok, I found some similar securities in prior day file. I think this may be due to a change we implemented today - Yedla made some enhancements to ZCCD860N, and I think as the result, records with blank cusips are written out, but before the change they were not
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:56 PM
Ok
Shall I ask them to verify?
They will take time to do this for sure
Or shall we proceed?
What do you suggest Lev?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:03 PM
no, all is good. I lloked at other files and it seems these records got dropped, as expected
like I said, I think this is due to our change, but no impact on the reports 
so let;s consider the data good
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:04 PM
Ok. Thanks
i will proceed with rest of the batch with date override
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:08 PM
ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:23 PM
ZCCD860N is running and waiting for resources 
contention with ZSMD940N OWNS EXCL on 
needs SHR SYSDSN CICSPRDV.NSM.DTPERXRF

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:25 PM
those msd jobs can run for some time
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:26 PM
It's done now
:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:28 PM
ZCCD860N is running
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:31 PM
ZCADM7CN report looks good
ZCCDP7CN as well
ZGCD407N went fine
All reports look good
Now I will pull the Pb files for 10/30
after checking with Satya
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:39 PM
remind him that besides date overrides, he proably needs to override GDG's fro Pershing and MSSB inputs
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:39 PM
Ok
You need to override GDG's fro Pershing and MSSB inputs apart from Date overrides
Are you doing it in your jobs?
Sorry Lev
wrong ping
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:40 PM
:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:41 PM
Lev, I am not seeing Mukul now a days in office
He comes late night and leaving ealry morning
Shall we send a mail to Appala statign that our changes will be deployed on 11/14 and we will delvier the file at 04:30 AM from 11.14
What do you say?
It's a small change Lev.. they can do it
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:43 PM
ok, just make it clear that 11/14 file will arrive after 4:40am - first time
mention that we were able to extend the date by a week to 11/14...since we mentiond 11/7 in the past, and we should take some credit too (i.e. we did this for CDW;s benefit so they have more time - dont say this)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:46 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:47 PM
but in the worst case, we can continue sending the file at 20:00, although the data will be from prior day and may be missing a few cusips. If this file is not critical for them, it should not be a problem. Current file is also missing a few cusips - the main reason MSD is moving to a different source
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:48 PM
Ok.. but who can confirm us the importance of the file
i am sure these poeple won't turn up until 2 weeks till catch ups are complete
Dev team should respond on this but I doubt Appala has ever raised this topic with them
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:49 PM
I thought you mentioned from prior Mukul's feedback that this is not a critical file
Mukul is new, right? I dont recall hearing his name in the past
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:50 PM
No Lev He was with dev team for 2 years
But he is a Mantas resource
Now he is looking after CDW as well after joining with GPA
He quit HCL and directly joined here
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:50 PM
ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:50 PM
:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:54 PM
I have been assigned with COB activities by Rajanikanth
It's on Dec5th
Am I right?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:55 PM
by me, and I also added Rajini as 2nd contact
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:55 PM
Ok..
5th PM EST?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:56 PM
i tried to give him one of the roles down at the applciation testing sectiion, but he couldn't see much with that. so I had to assign him as the secondary contact
not sure of the times...this is still so far away
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:57 PM
Ok..
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:57 PM
i guess it will be the usual - probably on Sat they will start running about 12pm (I dont remmeber:))
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:59 PM
yes.. I remember.. last it happened on Dec7th - Saturday afternoon
started in the afternnon
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:08 PM
I am stepping away for lunch for 20 mins and will be back 
Please ipng me for anything
Thanks
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:09 PM
I will probably be here when you come back. Or maybe not:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:10 PM
Ok Lev  no probs..

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:50 PM

I will restart them after they move out

:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:01 PM

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:20 PM
how did you select gen's to be deleted
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:21 PM
Which were created as part of 11/04 batch
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:22 PM
did you get them from SAR?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:22 PM
Yes Lev
Lev,

We have received  Preferred Broker trigger -  ZWSDIWPB for 11/04 business date at 11/05 08:00 EST as BAU due to which our successor jobs ran using 11/04 files. Since we are processing back dated preferred broker feeds and yet to catch up from 10/31 onwards, we need to clear few datasets which were created as part of yesterday’s run. We will process 11/04 feed files again

Through out of schedule once we are done with 11/03 feed files.

  Please provide your approval to run the below JCL.  Thanks for your help.

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:27 PM
I will initiate 10/31 batch after we receive Fillrcr for 10/30
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:28 PM
do we have ETA on that?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:29 PM
We received the FillRCR for 10/30
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:31 PM
ok, so 10/30 will run now (or soon), then we will run 10/31, 11/3, 11/4, 11/5 after we get rcr files for those dates, right?
and 11/4 will run again at some point
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:31 PM
yes Lev correct
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:32 PM
doe anything need to run out of schedule? since we "wasted" one trigger
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:33 PM
Yes.. we need to run the jobs thru out of schedule for 11/04 since we already received it
I checked the latest gens now and it look fine now
IOCS00S.PB.TURN.JCLLIB(ZCCR002N)

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:34 PM
ok, I think it doesn matter which date is run out of schedule - maybe after we are BAU, we will request to reinstate jobs for one day.  we can worry about it later
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:35 PM
Yes Lev. correct
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:35 PM
have any of Satya's jobs run for 11/4 or whatever date
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:35 PM
yes they ran 
I told him
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:35 PM
anyway - you can talk to him about it
and one more question
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:36 PM
Pls tell me Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:36 PM
are any CURR or ASOF files/gens in danger of disappearing
how do oyu track that?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:37 PM
Only Equity dataware fils are not there as informed
Other files - yes. we do have
They are sendign FI data
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:37 PM
ASOF is most critical because there is no way to go back
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:37 PM
and Equity data
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:38 PM
ok, keep an eye on this. also when Sarma gets back, make sure you explain to him for the future.
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:38 PM
We started receiving all other triggers except Ocean trigger - big files - ZWSDIWDS
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:38 PM
and maybe we need to extend RETPD on all the tapes that we care about
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:38 PM
For which, damage is already done 
Yes Lev
i will check with Storage management today on this
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:39 PM
thius is done by SN, we did sometihng like this a few months back
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:39 PM
Oh ok
then I will surely try to prevent this not to happen in future
As you said I will keep an eye for sure. on this 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:40 PM
x
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:40 PM
don't want to take any chance to miss any more:(
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:40 PM
I will try to find the SN INC or CHG
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:40 PM
ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:41 PM
not now, but remind me in a day or two
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:41 PM
CHG0000189386I 
I do have it Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:41 PM
ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:41 PM
save this for reference: CHG0000189386 - we used this to extend retention; there are also 2 Infoman items in it (change+activity)
You only gave me :)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:41 PM
I dont remember things...:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:41 PM
that is your msg ot me
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:42 PM
ok, this is not so bad. but if I offer it to you aain tomorrow - that will mean I am in trouble:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:43 PM
Sorry LevI did not get you..
you mean that if you send  again
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:45 PM
I meant...I forgot I gave this to you. That is not so good, but ok. But if I offer it again tomorrow, then I need some medical attention
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:46 PM
Not like that.. you have so many things thru various channels but we have only one Lev
So i can remember
It is difficult for you to remember
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:46 PM
it is good I can count on you:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:46 PM
:)
Lev I will step away for 10 minutes to have my breakfast cum Lunch and then will proceed with all batch issues
Do you have anythign to pass it to me for now?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:48 PM
cant think of anything - maybe just the Mukul and BR xref response
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:48 PM
Ok.. will check with them today and update you at your morning EST
Thank you so much Lev for your time
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:49 PM
thank you:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:49 PM
Just Fyi. I will provide an update about 10/30 reports
after thry run
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:04 PM
Fyi.. PB reports were created for 10/30 and they appear good
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:00 PM
Lev, when I checked with Mukul on this, he told me that he has already informed to Appala on this so Appala should get back on this it seems. 
As we decided, we will notify them through email stating that we are implementing on 11/14
I will ask Yedla to do this for us
after your go ahead
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:39 PM
what exactly are going to as Yedla to do?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:40 PM
Just replying to your mail
Since they are the ones who are implemting the changes
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:41 PM
you will ask Yedla to reply to my email?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:42 PM
Yes.. He will mentioned about implementation date and time of feed delivery
Is this not a good idea?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:43 PM
te new date should come from me, I think
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:44 PM
Ok.. you can mention new date in your reply
Yedla may send the implementation details in a day or 2 
Does this sound good?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:46 PM
ok, sounds good. they will need another reiminder, I am sure.
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:46 PM
Yes Lev. I strongly feel
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:46 PM
so I will send something this morning
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:46 PM
otherwise they don't bother
I could get hold of one person from Tape management. - Violanti, Vincent1 [CCC-OT]
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 9:47 PM
in the worst case, their job will fail and they will handlee it manually untril they change the date
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 9:47 PM
I am checking with him for any possibilities to restore the missign tapes
Yes.. correct
I will provide an update if I hear any good news. :P
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 11:16 PM
Violanti, Vincent1 [CCC-OT] 9:56 PM

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 11:48 PM
Lev is there anyway that we can the volume names for the old ASOF
*we can get the
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 11:54 PM
you mean get = recover data?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 11:55 PM
When I checked with Tape recovery team, he is asking about Volume numbers to check whether it can be recoverable or not
I can not find old job in SAR

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:36 AM
If we know the volume numbers then we can retrieve other 2 datasets for September data
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:38 AM
do you have any jcls that you may have run at that time woth volumes in them?
that;s where I found that one dataset
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:38 AM
I only tried with first one
SHS.NCA.PCAD783N.EQTORDHT.CURR.G0215V00

so i hv those volumes
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:39 AM
if these volumes exist anywhere, we should be able to get a full ist of them

Do we have anything similar to that?:P

Thanks
bye
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:38 AM
Lev, I need a small help
I could see that retrieval requests are pending 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:38 AM
did you get any rest?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:39 AM
I slept around 2 hrs back but they called me to check on retrieval request as Micheal raised a question
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:39 AM
oh-oh
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:40 AM
ZCAR699N - there is a DB2 check
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:41 AM
Mike Lyons?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:42 AM
Yes - he riased the question to Appala
which inturn gone to Sandeep then to me
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:42 AM
ok, what is it
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:42 AM
just checking our process
just forwarded the mail to you
how do they process pending requests
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:44 AM
"our process - how do they process":)
they probably have files-watcher which kicks off some batch script when we deliver the files
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:45 AM
But I dont see any load files being sent to them
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:45 AM
they load the files and send LoadResponse to us and we update status
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:46 AM
just waiting for their process since the DB2 was down
ZCAR699N is the last job that ran from our end
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:46 AM
I sdont have the job names, I think there is also zcar799n
db2 was down?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:47 AM
Not now..last week
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:47 AM
you actually mean DB2 (not CDW or Sybase)?

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:49 AM
ok, that makes sense now...to a certain point
what I dont see, why are they asking us? they should run their process. maybe force it manually if they have to
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:51 AM
they are not sure I guess what to do so he is checking with me
since they dont see the load files
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:51 AM
ok, so they lost some files?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:53 AM
I think our sftp jobs which sends the load files are not run due to their database issue
I may be wrong
ZCAR699N

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:59 AM
I sent one mail which has jpg files
retrieval flow
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:00 AM
these jobs zwsr701n have run, I now found them in SAR
I thought they were still waiting
the last opne that ran:
Changing mode on /export/cdwapp1/opt/cdwftp/DataRetrieval/StifTb.2014102805 

for 10/28
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:03 AM
Yes.
How our jobs will get triggered?
For what they are waiting for?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:05 AM
I believe CICS checks for requests in queue and starts zcar530n
form there it is all automatic
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:06 AM
But our sftp jobs which place the retrieval load files are yet to be run
They must be waiting some process at CDW end
Am I right?
Can u copy this into WRKT - PROD.NCA.ZCAR699N.MAINTRL.R4110401?

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:08 AM
our batch will run from zcar530n until the end and will send the files; then will start over for the next request, and so on
ECNS.NCA.ZCAR699N.MAINTRL.R4110401

wrkt is not a good idea at this time. they get scratched between 5-6 pm
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:10 AM
Ok..
if it is automated then our sftp job also should run for eg. ZWSR701N but which did not run after 10/28
Our process must be waiting some response from CDW - I guess?
SHS.NCA.CAW05.MAINSTIF.R4110305

I mean which are not yet used in the sftp jobs

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:25 AM
Ok
What is the remedy in this case?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:26 AM
do you know what program is updating the log?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:27 AM
ZCICSSP NCACLOG UPDATE

Not sure
I searched in N;S;2
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:28 AM
maybe CHGMAN.CMN.BDS.SRCLIB(NCAC505)

or 507
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:29 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:34 AM
20141028 05 is the request with status 18
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:35 AM
the last successful retrieval
ZWSRILDR

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:37 AM
where do yoiu find these status codes?
what they mean that is
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:42 AM
Not su
Not sure
will probably check 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:43 AM
either it just changed, or I was looking in a wrong place
that request has status 15 (prior status 18)
and all subsequent requests have status 18
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:45 AM
Ok
What do we tell them Lev? Did you get any idea? :)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:46 AM
I think we need to take action or tell them what we expect
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:46 AM
I am in call with them
What shuld I suggest to trigger at CDW end
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:47 AM
we can;t expect a miracle, i mean something needs to happen for the process to start working again
I dont have the answer, I but i will try to look into this
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:47 AM
35111_RetrievalLoadXmitTrig - ZWSRILDR
35111_RetrievalDeleteXmitTrig - ZWSRI52N
Ok..ok sorry. no probs
I will also take a look
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:47 AM
you may want to take some rest "we are looking into this"
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:48 AM
Appala was asking me the status in the call 
I said we are looking
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:48 AM
aand that has not changed
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:50 AM
hmm :)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:55 AM
status codes in this program ncac505, at line 80 approx
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:56 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:56 AM
so it looks like that request I mention is "loading"
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:58 AM

Which is before load or after load
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 6:01 AM
ok - so I would tell them we need ZWSRILDR
for request 20141028 05
this is their response that the request was loaded and apaprently we are waiting for that before sending the next one
but it is important that the correct request# is sent
that is how I see it
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:03 AM
Ok..sure .. will communicate
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 6:04 AM
i need to step away for 10 min
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:04 AM
Ok Lev
Please go ahead
i will update you
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 6:04 AM
in case you signing off - talk to you later:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:05 AM

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:37 AM
I have asked them to send the Load response
They sent it

yes, i saw it. the staus is now 09

have you just received an email?
about 15 minutes ago
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:46 AM
Yes.. I did
cics potential issue
just forwarded
What does it mean?
Issues with our end
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 6:49 AM
nothing interesting in the log, i copied 5000 records:
ECNS.NCA.NCACLOG

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:51 AM
Ok
Would CICS person can provide any details?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 6:59 AM
? what person
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 6:59 AM
CICS support person
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:00 AM
i think noone has looked into this for a few years at least; and those who did are probably no longer working here
this is application "issue"
CICS support people cant know our applciation
unless I am missing something?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:02 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:05 AM
looks like space condition is the only thing that can cause 09 status code; but I cant find the underlying cause
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:06 AM
space at our end
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:07 AM
it means nothing; but the logic is there
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:07 AM
ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:20 AM
I dont have clue on how to proceed on this?
Can you put me in some direction Lev?
:S
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:22 AM
I am looking at the code in NCAC505
and trying to make sense of status 09
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:22 AM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:22 AM
and I can;t so far
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:24 AM
I need to step away for 15 minutes - I am not sure why oyu are up still
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:25 AM
Sandeep is asking me the update 
Appala was also asking about the ETA
All of a sudden they came up and raised this in the night
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:27 AM
you can tell them that I am looking into it; and get some rest for now
I dont see a point in you staying up. tehre will bemany batch jobs requiring your attention
if you are too tired you will make mistakes
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:27 AM
Yes Lev..I agree
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:28 AM
go get rest now, I need to step away
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:28 AM
Ok..we got the Fillrcr trigger
I will run then for 10/31 and then take rest
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:28 AM
ok, now you got someting to do
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:28 AM
jobs are ready
I made them ready ysterday itself
hmm yes and couple of archival job fails as well
Thank you Lev
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:34 AM
PB report jobs ran fine for 10/31 and reports look good
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 7:57 AM
yes, reports look good
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 7:58 AM
Will there be any issues with this table - SPACE_CNTL?
 FROM SPACE_CNTL 
 WHERE SERVER_NBR = '01'

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:00 AM
SELECT SERVER_NBR, 
       TOTAL_SPACE 
  FROM ncadb2p.SPACE_CNTL 
  WHERE SERVER_NBR = '01' 
 SERVER_NBR TOTAL_SPACE 
 ------------- -------------- 
 01 54,000,000,000 
dont see any issues
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:00 AM
Ok
I am frequently gettting those emails
NCAC505
So far I got 4 mails from last 2 hrs
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:03 AM
because theose requests are pending load "LONG RUN"
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:04 AM
Ok
I seriously supect that this could have caused due to their database issues and their jobs on HOLD
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:05 AM
are you signing off?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:05 AM
I dont know Lev
i wish
Please tell me Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:06 AM
if you are notsigning off - then you work on it
I think you should get some rest
but if you re still on - go ahead and work on it
then I will work on othe rthings
you have to choose
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:07 AM
I will take rest for few hours and log in
is that ok?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:07 AM
yes, that is what I am trying to tell you
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 8:07 AM
Ok Lev. Thank you
I will ping you later
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 8:08 AM
ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:22 PM
Hi Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:22 PM
hello
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:24 PM
Is there anything that I can help you on retrieval
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:24 PM
I am a littel stuck, although I see many things now:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:24 PM
They woke me up due to job failure
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:24 PM
do you have any documentatiuon on this stuff :(
the latest: there are 4 request with atatus 11 "purging"
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:25 PM
Retreival - except flow diagrams no documentation available wiht me
Oh
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:26 PM
it seems that this program will not start ftps until it receives purge requests back
I am thinking of changing these 4 requests, but I am not sure how 
I know how - ut change to what
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:28 PM
Does CDW send these purge requests to us?
what is the program?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:28 PM
NCAC505
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:28 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:29 PM
ZCAR599N, ZWSR599N <- very hard to trace but they exist
ZWSR522N; ZCAD520N
pgm NCAB721
too many things to figure out without a good document
I am also noticing that many requests still pending, have purge date in the past
not sure if system will handle that
for example 
entered on 10/30, purge date 11/02
I think since we have to do something.....
I will set up an update job for all these requests, and we will giove it a try
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:33 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:33 PM
1. change the 4 request to "normal" status  2. change purge dates on pending requests to 11/14 or something
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:33 PM
otherwise shall we do one request first then if is successful then the remaining
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:34 PM
I dont think we can
unless you know better
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:34 PM
I mean through one-off jobs by AGCC
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:34 PM
this system ius too smart and if we try to full it, it may break
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:35 PM
ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:35 PM
no, I think it is dangerous to even try
i need a 10 min break and I will start on it
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:36 PM
Ok Lev.. lot of new things to learn :)
pls carry on
There is a need to document this
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:38 PM
I will do it afer we resolve this issue
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 12:44 PM
this is going to be diffcult to document:)
because I dont have a full picture
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 12:45 PM
Ok

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:17 PM
Yes
He only
Muthu s are always Male
I will ask him to run it fo rus
what is the INC?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:17 PM
he ran these jobs already, I will reasiign back to him
you wnat me to assign to you?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:18 PM
No need to assign him
We jsut need to update the INC
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:19 PM
ok, will do. we need to run the same jobs again 1.spufi update 2.zca#699n (which is the same as zca#799n)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:20 PM
Pls assign the INC to me
i will take care of INC updates
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:20 PM
ok, I will put in my comments
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:20 PM
which I have been used to for all these days :)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:23 PM
Once this job runs then I will ask him to run these jobs from TURN library
ZCA#699N
ZCA#799N

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:24 PM
no
both jobs are in the INC
These two jobs need to run again as more issues with data have been discovered which need to be corrected:
1. please run one-time job ZCAR7RQN from IOCS00S.PB.TURN.JCLLIB(ZCAR7RQN)
2. if successful please run job ZCA#699N from IOCS00S.PB.TURN.JCLLIB(ZCA#699N)

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:24 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:25 PM
assigned to you - check it, see if you need to comment and reassign to Muru
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:25 PM
Ok. I will take care
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:25 PM
one good question....will this work?
:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 1:27 PM
ZCA#699N  - What is the significance of this job?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 1:28 PM
same as #799 - both start transaction NCAC - pgm NCAC505
NCAC505 decides what to run next
"sort of"

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:23 PM

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:24 PM
that ; messed everything up
i need some more time to put a fix together, may nto be 100%, but have to try
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:25 PM
ok
you mean our query updated all 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:28 PM
yes, the first one without the where
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:28 PM
Oh.
shall we update the status before the entries with 20141028 05
?
to old values
If you are in the middle pls carry on
I dont wnat to interrupt you
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:35 PM
I think I can get it pretty close
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:36 PM
Is it available in TURN Library?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:36 PM
not yet
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:36 PM
Ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:53 PM
are you working on the Sql?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:54 PM
almost done, I also ran select with the same "where" as will run in the update
I will send you a spreadsheet with many tabs
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 2:55 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 2:58 PM
I think I need to explain what the tabs are
The last one is the SQL to fix the situation, I am still reviewing
The first one is the original list, but only includes status > 09
second is the SQL we ran, with errors
third is the select * after the bad run
next 4 table are select results using WHERE from the Update SQL in the last tab
they dont add up to the total, because 14 (or 13) requests will remain as status 03 / purged
confusing enough?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:02 PM
No Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:02 PM
1st update is for No Data
2nd foir pending load
3rd and 4th for "avaialble'
I wnat to take a 5 minute break then will take another look and will update the TURN job
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:03 PM
Ok. 
Need to veriy the results once all 4 updates are done as per your spread sheet
Am I right?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:03 PM
this time we want to run the update job onloy, then look at the results - and only then run ZCA#699n
yes, exactly
I will be back in 5, and will have naother look. but  please check it too
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:04 PM
Ok
what about this sql's in the initial job?
UPDATE DB2PRD03.NCADB2P.REQUEST_CNTL 
   SET PROJ_PURGE_DT = '2014-11-14', 
       ACT_PURGE_DT = '2014-11-14' 
 WHERE REQ_STATUS = '18' AND PROJ_PURGE_DT < '2014-11-12';
UPDATE DB2PRD03.NCADB2P.REQUEST_CNTL 
   SET LAST_MOD_TIMESTMP = '2014-10-28 15:20:11.814322' 
 WHERE KEY_BASE = '20141028' AND SEQ_NBR = '05'; 

Should I add these 2 in the JCL at the end?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:11 PM
Yes, I was going to do that. main focus on the fix....
they would go at the end
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:14 PM
i dont see any issues
I think it may work this time
:(
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:15 PM
Yes.
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:15 PM
ok, let me update the jcl?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:15 PM
prior status is 1 in the original records
are we not changeing that?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:16 PM
only on those with status 11 - we want them as 03 prior 11, just like they are now
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:16 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:20 PM
I saved the jcl - take alook
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:20 PM
Ok
Yes Lev.. this time.. there will be no issues
I will get it run 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:23 PM
just one job, then we will look at the requests, then will run zca#699n
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:23 PM
Ok sure
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:30 PM
Lev completed
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:31 PM
let me see
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:31 PM
Ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:35 PM
I just had a look..it looks ok but you are the correct person to judge it
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:36 PM
yes looks ok to me
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:36 PM
I will ask to run the second job
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:37 PM
ok, I hope this produces desired results
otherwise all this was a waste of time:(
and I wouldnt know what to try next
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:37 PM
you are stretching for long time
Sorry Lev
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:39 PM
This job runs at 7:00 every day ZCAD520N - it may do something with purge requests; just keep it in mind. I hope nothing bad will happen
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:39 PM
Ok
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:43 PM
second job ran fine
Great
ZCAR560N ran fine
ZWSR701N failed
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:45 PM
I think it is the same issue with tapes that expire too soon
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:47 PM
I saw them this moring Lev
But they are gone now
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:47 PM
I submitted the job
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:47 PM
which job?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:48 PM
tape listing
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:48 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:48 PM
but I will run again, to cover more files. I only submitted for stif
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:48 PM
available from SHS.NCA.CAW05.MAINSTIF.R4103001

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:50 PM
yes, the tape list produces the same as the catalog
do you think it is worth looking in SAR for vol ser's ?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:51 PM
Mike lyons is alos not asking the old data Lev
he is asking abt the latest
so shall we start running from 10/30?
What do you say?
If required we can request the users to rerequest them since they are 10 days back requests unless you disagree with me
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:52 PM
in the meantime, we have a slight mess
and we should backup the tape which are there today
as they may be gone any minute:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:53 PM
Ok.. I will request thsi evening 
throu an excel
by taking from SAR
Ok.. got it
exisint tapes
yes
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:54 PM
ok, we are missing 4 requests for 10/28 # 5,6,7,8
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:56 PM
I wil make a note of them and park it
I think we need to update the table so taht it picks up from 10/30
Am I right Lev?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:57 PM
ok, what status to we assign to these so they start extracting again?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:57 PM
will give 18 for now
we will change later
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:58 PM
I think 13 pending recall
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:58 PM
Oh..sorry
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:58 PM
no, 18 means ogm will try to send them to cdw
in turn
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 3:58 PM
Ok..ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 3:59 PM
we need to cancel 560 and whatever follows in the app - right?
I mean zwsr701n
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:00 PM
Yes..
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:00 PM
it may be the last one and nothing else after it
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:01 PM
I am checking with AGCC
ZWSR700N
is successor
I checkit in JOBDOC link
All jobs failed withJCL error
I sent you an email
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:05 PM
Lev I will instruct them to mark complete failed once
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:06 PM
yes
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:08 PM
Can u run this - WRKT.USER.KAMESH(TAPECOPY)

tape backup to ECNS with RETPD - 30 days
Lev, pls prepare sql for updation if possibel and take rest
I will manage the rest
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:14 PM
I updated the jcl, please take look
make sure they refresh the jcl
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:14 PM
Sure..will do
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:14 PM
I think we also want to check the table before runnig ZCA#699N
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:15 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:15 PM
I think what may happen, it will start retrieval requests again 
wait, I think need to change something
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:16 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:16 PM
no, never mind
all 4 had data. I though one did not, but al of them do
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:18 PM
Shall I get thsi run?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:19 PM
yes
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:19 PM
OK
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:19 PM
I will take 5
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:20 PM
Ok thank you
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:27 PM
i tihnk we may wnat to update something, if not too late?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:27 PM
job completed
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:27 PM
ok, 
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:27 PM
What is that Lev?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:27 PM
which request was Mike asking about?
he had one specific request in mind
2 of these 10./28 requests are pretty long (2years of stif), they may run for a while
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:28 PM
11/04/14 requested by ALAN SHAPIRO
2014-EQ238 STIF2
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:28 PM
I am thinking, maybe by updating timestamps, we can puch the loads/ftps first
no, never mind
first cursor is
ORDER BY REQ_STATUS, 
         ENTRY_TIMESTMP, 
         LAST_MOD_TIMESTMP 

so the retrievals will run first anyway
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:31 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:31 PM
i think 699 ran
and 530 probably too?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:32 PM
Not yet
Shall I ask him to run
ZCA#699N
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:32 PM
wait then
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:32 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:32 PM
one sec
it is running:)
i saw status change to 12 prior 13, request #5
that's fine
I think
no need to ask him
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:34 PM
hmm Ok
now the retrieval jobs are running
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:38 PM
ok, so hopefully all wil run by itself.
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:38 PM
it's great news finally for us
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:38 PM
the only thing - if after the last of these 4 requests is loaded - if all stops, then we may need to run ZCA#699N
I am not really sure any more
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:39 PM
Ok..sure will check the table and proceed
it's already late for u
please take rest
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:40 PM
ok, now that all is running, you have time to document everything:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:40 PM
Do you have access to work by any chance?
sure will do 
Lev, I will have a look into your message adn will check with some time next week when you have time
i mean in this weekend
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:40 PM
access to work?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:40 PM
and prepare the document
work datasets
WORK.NGC.PGCD284N.MRGPOS
WORK.NGC.PGCD284N.WTCHQSP.SAL

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:40 PM
some probably
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:40 PM
Pls try and ocpy
If not I will prepare a job
There are failures
wich I am addressing parallely
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:42 PM
no, not work.ngc - dont have them
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:42 PM
Ok no probs
I will monitor the retrieval batch 
if any issues I will get the 699n run
Please go to bed
Thank you so much 
I would not have proceeded much with out your help today
I will have my breakfastcum Lunchcum supper now parallely
:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:44 PM
next time this will be easier, I hope:)
I havte this type of work, what it is like guesswork
and little typos dont help at all
what about PB jobs - will they kick off at 8:00am again ?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:46 PM
Yes.. main issue is request are forced to mvoe to Purge status due to their database issue
Correct lev?
I put them on HOLD
as of now 11/03 went fine
I will take care
they are very simple to me now :)
by seeing all these failures
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:47 PM
just 4 requests may be hanging; the rest seem to have been purged already
maybe someday you can ask CDW to run a list of all requests still loaded
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:48 PM
What is the main reason for this?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:48 PM
to see what we may have as 'purged' but it is still loaded
so we can reconcile, and maybe ask them to purge manually
this can be done later-later maybe in 2-3 weeks or so...to be sure that noone is using these requests
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:50 PM
Ok..
In other words our requests are in hang state due to cdw databas outage
Shall I put in this way for expalnation?
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:52 PM
not exactly "hang", because they maybe laoded and online; but they may stay like that forever
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 4:52 PM
Ok
Thank you so much Lev
pls go to bed
Have a good sleep
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 4:55 PM
I had a lot of other work which did not get done:(   but weekend is coming
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:01 PM
Oh. retrieval issue eaten all of your time
Sorry and thank you
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:01 PM
that had to be done
users would not be happy at all
and bythe way...we are not "home safe" yet
do they have baseball in Singapore ?
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:02 PM
No..
:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:02 PM
do you know what home and safe mean
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:03 PM
Not exactly Lev
What is that?
If it is 100% resolved then we can use this 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:03 PM
I am not a baseball fan, but I used to watch about 28 years ago
basically, home plate is where the batter stands and tries to hit the ball
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:04 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:04 PM
when he hits the ball and runs around the 3 bases and comes to home plate - he scores
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:05 PM
ok so we are not yet completd 3 bases :)
only 1 is done
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:05 PM
"safe" means safe at base or safe at home (base) ; safe as opposed as tagged out by the opposing team player
anyway... it's a long way...
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:06 PM
ZWSR701N ran 4 times till now
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:06 PM
oh - good news
so it does run concurrently
that program is difficult to navigate
even though built from performs - very over-done with that
but  it works - thats what counts
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:07 PM
but still i am gettign these emails
Potential problem has been detected by the on-line control program NCAC505. 
Please check on-line log file: CICSPRDV.NCA.NCACLOG 
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:07 PM
and that also means we received loadresponse 3 or 4 times
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:08 PM
Oh..if we receive more nuber of time sthen also we will get this message
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:10 PM
once these jobs complete, it will go away
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:11 PM
Ok
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:11 PM
all requests taht is
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:11 PM
Ok

Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:17 PM
no, I dont have that:)
I am going to signoff now
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:18 PM
Ok.. Lev
Please
Thank you so much
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:18 PM
just to warn you - I may sleep longer than usual today:)
Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:18 PM
Sure.. Have good sleep 
:)
Barinsky, Lev [CCC-OT] 5:18 PM

Somarouthu, Kameswararao [CCC-OT NE] 5:19 PM
Ok.. pls take proper rest
Thank you
Good night and morning :)
